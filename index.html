        &ldquo;And God created great whales.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Genesis</i>.

      <p>
        &ldquo;Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to
        be hoary.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Job</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Jonah</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There go the ships; there is that Leviathan whom thou hast made to play
        therein.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Psalms</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword, shall
        punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked
        serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Isaiah</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster&rsquo;s
        mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that
        foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his
        paunch.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Holland&rsquo;s Plutarch&rsquo;s Morals</i>.

        &ldquo;The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among
        which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in
        length as four acres or arpens of land.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Holland&rsquo;s Pliny</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
        great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
        former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,
        open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before
